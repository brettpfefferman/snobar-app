## Getting Started
Users will be able to create an account in order to create and share recipes they've come up with using SnoBar icecream products.

## Future Plans
Would like to create an opening page where if a user enters the website for the first time, they will have to enter their date of birth, as this website serves for people who are 21 years or older.
